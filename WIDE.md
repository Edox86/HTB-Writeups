# üß¨ Hack The Box - Reversing Challenge Write-Up:[WIDE] ‚Äì [03/08/2025]
***

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Challenge Overview
- **Objective:** retrieve the HTB flag
- **Link to the challenge:** https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/WIDE
- **Challenge Description:** We've received reports that Draeger has stashed a huge arsenal in the pocket dimension Flaggle Alpha. You've managed to smuggle a discarded access terminal to the Widely Inflated Dimension Editor from his headquarters, but the entry for the dimension has been encrypted. Can you make it inside and take control?
- **Difficulty:** Very Easy
- **üì¶ Provided Files**:
	- File: `WIDE.zip`  
	- Password: `hackthebox`
	- SHA256: `362a8400f67d0bba0927ac161c8a4dcbc5462d9c0a909c421f79ddff3d39f9f7` 
- **üì¶ Extracted Files**:
 db.ex 
 wide

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
- **Operating System:** `Kali Linux`
- **Tools Used:**
  - Static: `file`, `sha256sum`, `strings`, `ldd`
  - Dynamic: `ltrace`, `Ghidra`

## üîç Static Analysis

#### Initial Observations
- File
```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Downloads/rev_wide]
‚îî‚îÄ$ file db.ex    
db.ex: data

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Downloads/rev_wide]
‚îî‚îÄ$ file wide 
wide: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=13869bb7ce2c22f474b95ba21c9d7e9ff74ecc3f, not stripped
```

It‚Äôs a 64-bit, position-independent, dynamically linked, non-stripped ELF executable for x86-64 Linux (kernel ‚â• 3.2), using /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 as its loader.
Binary without stripes is good because we can still read the symbols.

- ldd

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Downloads/rev_wide]
‚îî‚îÄ$ ldd wide     
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffb9fd7000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fc1e4c0a000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fc1e51c2000)
```

It depends solely on the kernel‚Äôs vDSO, glibc (libc.so.6), and the standard 64-bit dynamic loader /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 at runtime‚Äîno other shared libraries are required.

- strings

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Downloads/rev_wide]
‚îî‚îÄ$ strings db.ex 
Primus
people breathe variety practice
Our home dimension
Cheagaz

The Hungry Dimension
Maraqa

The Water Dimension
Aidor
feathers stream sides gate
The Bone Dimension
Flaggle Alpha
admin secret power hidden
HOt*

```

Apart from the last two strings, it doesn‚Äôt appear to be encrypted. There is another clue here: Flaggle Alpha, which was mentioned earlier in the challenge description, so let‚Äôs keep that in mind. Also, it‚Äôs close to the word ‚Äúadmin‚Äù and that seemingly encrypted final part.

I see many useful calls where we could set breakpoints in the future. Among these, a few caught my attention (because another file was provided by the challenge‚Äîit needs to be opened by the executable, so we can track down fopen). We also see what appears to be the program menu (asking which dimension we want to access, and we‚Äôll probably need to answer with `Flaggle Alpha`), but I also see the program usage: `Usage: %s db.ex`, which means WIDE expects the file db.exe as a parameter. I also see the string `please enter your WIDE decryption key:`, which suggests we need to provide the correct password to decrypt the secrets. And a username seems to be hardcoded: `kr4eq4L2$12xb`.

To be honest, this seems to be a very straightforward challenge (no sign of strong anti-debug tricks or heavily encrypted parts), so I‚Äôd rather avoid static analysis with objdump and readelf this time.

Let‚Äôs move on to check the execution behavior to get a better overview of its functioning.

```

The behavior above confirms that the program requires `db.ex` as a parameter. It then prints the "rules" of the game and the available "dimensions" (choices) that can be accessed. The program appears to be structured around a loop that prints the string `Which dimension would you like to examine?` and waits for user input (likely using `fgets`). It only accepts numeric inputs from 0 (our dimension) up to 6 (the challenge target with the encrypted dimension/secret).

Based on testing the other dimensions, we get a clearer picture of the structure of the `db.ex` file, which seems to be composed of a sequence of: dimension name + dimension description + dimension secret (whether encrypted or not).

So from this, we understand that our goal is to find the correct key to decrypt the final string contained in `db.ex`.

Let‚Äôs now use `ltrace` to examine the program‚Äôs behavior step by step, aiming to identify which specific functions are called at each stage (and possibly leak some hardcoded comparison values as well).

fgets(Which dimension would you like to examine? 
```

The above confirms the use of several functions: `puts` and `printf` are used to print the menu and other information, while `fopen`, `fseek`, `ftell`, `fread`, and `fclose` handle the `db.ex` file. Specifically, the program reads `db.ex` at the beginning, loads its contents into newly allocated memory, and then closes the file. So after this initial step, `db.ex` is no longer needed since all its data resides in memory.

We also confirm the use of a `fgets` loop to capture user input.

Let‚Äôs now observe what happens when the user provides input.

```bash
fgets(Which dimension would you like to examine? 1
"1\n", 32, 0x7fabace2c8e0)                                                                                     = 0x7ffcefae6dd0

fgets(Which dimension would you like to examine?
```

This effectively solves the challenge, as the correct key was leaked in plaintext. But let‚Äôs break down the output step by step:

- `strtol` is used to convert the user's input from a string to a number‚Äîthis is likely to branch into a `switch` statement based on the chosen dimension.
    
- The program then prints the name of the selected dimension, outputs the secret stored in the file, and re-enters the `fgets` input loop.
    

If the Flaggle Alpha branch is selected (via digit 6), the program prompts the user to enter a password with another `fgets`. Since we didn‚Äôt know the password at first, I entered `hola`. This input was then converted into a wide character string using the `mbstowcs` function and compared with the hardcoded wide character string `sup3rs3cr3tw1d3`.

This is the password required to obtain the secret and complete the challenge: `sup3rs3cr3tw1d3`.

```bash
fgets(Which dimension would you like to examine? 6
"6\n", 32, 0x7fabace2c8e0)                                                                                     = 0x7ffcefae6dd0
strtol("6\n", nil, 10)                                                                                               = 6
printf("[X] That entry is encrypted - pl"...)                                                                        = 69

I would have been much faster by opening it directly with Ghidra or IDA, but I always go through all the above steps for training and methodological purposes‚Äîto practice reading outputs and to train the mind in connecting clues and patterns.

In this case, the challenge centered around the use of wide characters as a form of obfuscation, making it harder to directly reveal the secret using tools like the `strings` command.

For the sake of completeness, let‚Äôs take a look at what Ghidra‚Äôs `main` function looks like:

- **Ghidra:**

```bash
undefined8 main(int param_1,undefined8 *param_2)

  int iVar1;
  FILE *__stream;
  ulong uVar2;
  void *__ptr;
  uint uVar3;
  int local_28;
  
  if (param_1 < 2) {
    printf("Usage: %s db.ex\n",*param_2);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(-1);
  }
  puts("[*] Welcome user: kr4eq4L2$12xb, to the Widely Inflated Dimension Editor [*]");
  puts("[*]    Serving your pocket dimension storage needs since 14,012.5 B      [*]");
  __stream = fopen((char *)param_2[1],"r");
  if (__stream == (FILE *)0x0) {
    puts("[x] There was a problem accessing your database [x]");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(-1);
  }
  fseek(__stream,0,2);
  uVar2 = ftell(__stream);
  fseek(__stream,0,0);
  uVar2 = (uVar2 - uVar2 % 0xb4) / 0xb4;
  iVar1 = (int)uVar2;
  __ptr = calloc((long)iVar1,0xb4);
  fread(__ptr,0xb4,(long)iVar1,__stream);
  fclose(__stream);

  for (local_28 = 0; local_28 < iVar1; local_28 = local_28 + 1) {
    if (*(int *)((long)__ptr + (long)local_28 * 0xb4) == 0) {
      uVar3 = 0x20;
    }
    else {

A very easy challenge, but in this case, understanding the entire pseudo C code through Ghidra would have been more time-consuming than using the `ltrace` approach.
