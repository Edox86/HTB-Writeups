From `ltrace`, I can see that the code calls `memset` and `strlen` with our input (which is something I can set a breakpoint on later), and then makes use of `sigemptyset` and `sigaction`. But what exactly are these functions?

These are functions related to process signaling.

**Signals** are a mechanism by which the operating system or a process can **asynchronously notify** another process that **a specific event has occurred**.

Think of them as **interrupts**‚Äîthey "interrupt" a program to handle something that requires immediate attention.

Some common examples of signals include:

| Signal    | Description                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `SIGINT`  | Sent when you press `Ctrl+C`                 |
| `SIGTERM` | Sent to ask a process to terminate           |
| `SIGKILL` | Forcefully kills a process (can‚Äôt be caught) |
| `SIGSEGV` | Segmentation fault (invalid memory access)   |
| `SIGCHLD` | Sent to parent when a child process ends     |
| `SIGALRM` | Timer alarm goes off                         |
| `SIGILL`  | Illegal Instruction                          |
### üîß What Happens When a Signal Is Sent?

When a process receives a signal, **one of three things** can happen:

1. The **default action** is taken (e.g., termination, ignoring the signal).
    
2. The process **handles it** using a **signal handler** (a custom-defined function).
    
3. The signal is **blocked**, meaning it is temporarily ignored.
    

Now, specifically, the `_sigemptyset` function in C is used to initialize a signal set (a data structure) to be **empty**, meaning it contains **no signals**.

The `sigaction` function in Unix/Linux is used to **define how a process handles a particular signal**. Essentially, it sets a **custom handler** for a specific signal (like `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, etc.), allowing the code to control **how that signal is processed**.

So, what is our code doing with these signals?  
Let‚Äôs review everything in IDA.

## üî¨ IDA Analysis

### `main` Function

```

; int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
public main
main proc near

var_B0= qword ptr -0B0h
var_A4= dword ptr -0A4h
s= qword ptr -0A0h
var_18= dword ptr -18h
var_8= qword ptr -8

; __unwind { // 555555554000
endbr64
push    rbp
mov     rbp, rsp
sub     rsp, 0B0h
mov     [rbp+var_A4], edi
mov     [rbp+var_B0], rsi
mov     rax, fs:28h
mov     [rbp+var_8], rax
xor     eax, eax
lea     rax, [rbp+s]
mov     edx, 98h        ; n
mov     esi, 0          ; c
mov     rdi, rax        ; s
call    _memset
lea     rax, [rbp+s]
add     rax, 8
mov     rdi, rax        ; set
call    _sigemptyset
lea     rax, segill_sigaction
mov     [rbp+s], rax
mov     [rbp+var_18], 4
lea     rax, [rbp+s]
mov     edx, 0          ; oact
mov     rsi, rax        ; act
mov     edi, 4          ; sig
call    _sigaction
ud2
main endp
```

- **Zero a scratch buffer** (`memset(&s, 0, 0x98)`)
    
- **Prepare a `struct sigaction`** in that buffer, pointing its handler to the function `segill_sigaction`.
    
- **Install it for `SIGILL`** (`sigaction(4, &act, NULL)`) --> basically install a handler to catch illegal instruction
    
- **Execute a `ud2` instruction**, which is the x86 ‚Äúinvalid opcode‚Äù trap‚Äîthis immediately raises a `SIGILL`, which your new handler catches.

iIt‚Äôs a clever way to hide the real entry point. However, we still have our call to `strlen`, which we can trace to see where the code leads. So, let‚Äôs look for references to `_strlen` ‚Äî and we find only one, located at:

```
.text:000055555555531E                 call    _strlen
```

## üîç Password Logic Reverse Engineering

Here is a screenshot of the code that calls `strlen`:

![[Reversing/Behind the Scenes/1.png]]

After checking the length of our input (which must be 12 characters to proceed), it performs a series of `strncmp` calls ‚Äî suggesting that it‚Äôs verifying a password.

In fact, IDA already reveals parts of these strings, so we have a partial password. Let‚Äôs try to reconstruct the full password, either manually or using `ltrace`.

## ‚úÖ Challenges Encountered / Lessons Learned

- Explored how Linux signals work (`SIGILL`, `sigaction`, `sigemptyset`)
- Learned that a custom signal handler can hide the main logic
- Used `ltrace` to efficiently brute-force chunked password checks

---
##  üèÅ Conclusion

Although this challenge was marked as *Very Easy*, it cleverly used Linux signals to hide the real code path and required both static and dynamic approaches to understand the password-checking logic.

## üí° Additional Notes / Reflections
None.
