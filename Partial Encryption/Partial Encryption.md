I noticed some obfuscated strings, random ASCII characters, common language runtime usage (typical of C/C++ applications on Windows), and some interesting function calls such as: `memset`, `putchar`, `VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualProtect`, `VirtualFree`, along with other functions that can be useful to break in dynamic analysis.

---
### Windows Analysis

**First things first:** let's rename the file from `.exe` to `.bin` to avoid accidental execution.

---

### CFF Explorer

I used **CFF Explorer** on Windows to quickly perform a static analysis of the file. Here's what I found:

- **PE64**
    
- **Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0**
    
- **Size:** only 13 KB
    
- **Machine:** AMD64
    
- **Sections:** 5
    
- **NT Timestamp:** `0x61EE9CAE` ‚Äî nothing unusual; it decodes to a valid date
    
- In the **Optional Header**, nothing special: the entry point is in the `.text` section as expected
    
- **Subsystem:** Windows Console (CLI application)
    
- **Data Directories Present:** `import`, `exception`, `relocation`, `debug` (interesting ‚Äî we could investigate this further), and `configuration directory` (I haven‚Äôt worked with this one before, so I‚Äôll take a look using PE Bear)
    

As mentioned, no suspicious sections detected. The 5 sections are:

- `.text`
    
- `.rdata`
    
- `.data`
    
- `.pdata`
    
- `.reloc`
    

There are no significant differences between the **VA size** and **Raw Size**. Also, no other executable regions apart from `.text` ‚Äî nothing suspicious here.

---

### Import Address Table (IAT) Analysis

The IAT shows `KERNEL32.dll` and `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, which is expected for a VC++ executable on Windows. There are some malware-like APIs, but honestly, I‚Äôd rather not focus too much on the exported APIs from `KERNEL32.dll`, as they can often be invoked by CRT initializers multiple times ‚Äî they may well be false positives. So let‚Äôs skip that part.

---

### Debug Directory

The debug directory shares the same timestamp as the NT header, so no signs of tampering there.

---

Nothing else particularly useful at this stage. Let's move on to the next tool to get a better understanding of the other data directories or check for any visual encryption within the sections.

### PE Bear

- **Rich Header Analysis:**  
    The analysis of the Rich Header (typically encrypted, but the PE Header can decrypt it) confirms a **Visual Studio 2015 build**.
    
- **Load Config Directory:**  
    This only shows the information required to set up a secure process (e.g. `SecurityCookie`, `GuardCFCheck` function address, etc.).  
    Nothing particularly useful here.
---

## üíª Dynamic Analysis

### Behavior Analysis

Since it's a relatively simple challenge, I won't spend time analyzing events, network activity, etc. Instead, let's just take a look at what happens when the binary is executed from the command line (warning - always in VM and previous to snapshot creation):

```bash
C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\rev_partialencryption>partialencryption.exe
./chal <flag>
```

So the expected usage is to pass an argument to the executable.
```bash
C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\rev_partialencryption>partialencryption.exe hola
Nope

C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\rev_partialencryption>partialencryption.exe hola123
Nope

C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\rev_partialencryption>chal.exe hola
Nope

```

The binary simply returns `"Nope"` for incorrect inputs, and it appears both `partialencryption.exe` and `chal.exe` exhibit the same behavior.

### IDA Free 9.1

Let‚Äôs proceed with the **IDA Free** analysis.

Since I already know the challenge requires a string parameter, I set the argument `hola123` when running the binary inside IDA.

As soon as the binary is loaded, we're presented with the `main` function. A quick scan of the calls and strings shows some `putchar` calls and three function calls in total.

---

During the first execution, I step over the initial calls:

- The **first call** checks whether any parameters were passed (if not, the program exits).
    
- The **second call**, when stepped over, immediately terminates the program (because the parameter we provided is incorrect).
    

So, the **second call** is our area of interest ‚Äî this is where the flag comparison logic takes place.

 ![Screenshot](./1.png)

Let‚Äôs step into that second function and examine its logic:

 ![Screenshot](./2.png)

At the beginning of the function, we see:

- Parameters being saved into local variables
    
- Stack preparation
    
- Initialization of `var_38` to zero ‚Äî this will serve as a **loop counter**
    

In the following block, the counter is compared against 22, indicating a loop structure like: `for (i = 0; i < 22; i++)`. But **what exactly are we looping through**? That‚Äôs what we need to find out next.


In the next block, we observe the program setting a pointer to `argv[1]` and checking each character individually. It looks for the string terminator (`\0`) ‚Äî indicating the **end of the input string**. If the character at the current index is not `0`, it skips the conditional block and proceeds here:

 ![Screenshot](./3.png)

This simply increments the counter and restarts the loop, continuing until it reaches the end of the input string. 

 ![Screenshot](./4.png)

When it reach the end of the input string, execution moves here:

 ![Screenshot](./5.png)

Since the input is incorrect anyway, I decided to **cheat by patching the ZF (Zero Flag)** to force entry into the yellow block and analyze it.

The first small block is trivial:
```asm
eax = 0  
if (eax == 1) goto counter_increment
```

(So, effectively a no-op in this case.)

---

### Yellow Block Analysis

1. The value `0x40` (`@`) is loaded into `edx` - this will see is used as decryption key-
    
2. A memory address from the `.data` section is loaded into `rcx`.  
    It contains:
 ![Screenshot](./6.png)

Likely the **encrypted payload**.

A function is called ‚Äî I followed it:

- First, it makes a call to `VirtualAlloc`, presumably to allocate new memory for the **decrypted content**.
    
- The following block clearly shows a **loop performing arithmetic operations**, which strongly suggests this is the **decryption routine**.
        
 ![Screenshot](./7.png)

I continued to trace the decryption process and observed the output in memory:

 ![Screenshot](./8.png)

- It‚Äôs **not a string**, but it **resembles opcodes**, which confirms that what‚Äôs being decrypted is **executable code**.
    
- As suspected, a `VirtualProtect` call follows, which marks this newly decrypted memory region as **executable**.  
    After checking the decrypted function:

 ![Screenshot](./9.png)

1. It simply prints **"Nope"** ‚Äî confirming this is the failure message.  
    So, somewhere else, there **must also be a decryption of the success path**.
    
2. After this, the program:
    
    - Stores the address of the decrypted "Nope" code in a few variables
        
    - Calls the function to display the message
        
    - Calls `VirtualFree` to clean up the memory
        
    - Resets `eax` to `0`
        

---

### Red Block

Immediately after, a **similar decryption routine** appears ‚Äî I‚Äôve marked this one as **red**.  
This time, the decryption **uses `0x30` as the key**:    

 ![Screenshot](./10.png)

Following the same process:

- It decrypts a new chunk of memory
    
- I analyzed the result:    

 ![Screenshot](./11.png)

It appears to be an **exit routine**, which is then executed to terminate the program.

### Backtracking and New Direction

At this point, there's **no more code left to dynamically explore** ‚Äî and all execution paths so far have led to failure. So it's time to **walk back, re-evaluate the clues**, and determine the next logical step.

---

### Challenge Details

- **Name:** _Partial Encryption_
    
- **Description:** _Static analysis on this program didn't reveal much. There must be a better way to approach this..._
    

This clearly suggests that **some important logic is hidden at runtime**, and **not easily visible through static analysis**. Based on what we've seen so far, it's evident that:

- Execution exits early through one of the dynamically decrypted functions (e.g. `decrypted_exit`).
    
- There's likely **another path in `main` that we never reach** due to this early exit.
    
- The name _Partial Encryption_ implies only _parts_ of the binary are encrypted at runtime, possibly conditionally decrypted.
    

---

### Strategy: Runtime Patching

The idea is to **bypass the early exit** and continue execution within the original `main` function.

So I patched the call to the `decrypted_exit` function using NOPs:

 ![Screenshot](./12.png)

This effectively **neutralizes the premature exit**, allowing execution to flow back into the rest of `main`.
### Result: Access to New Code

After bypassing the exit, I successfully returned to a deeper section of the `main` function:

 ![Screenshot](./13.png)

Following this new path reveals **additional decrypted blocks**, similar to what we've seen earlier ‚Äî likely decrypted in-memory using routines that:

- Load encrypted data from the `.data` section
    
- Use a key (`edx` value) and a loop to decode the content
    
- Allocate executable memory with `VirtualAlloc`
    
- Set permissions with `VirtualProtect`
    
- Execute the now-decrypted logic
    

---

### Outcome

As a result of this bypass, **four new code sections were decrypted and executed** ‚Äî unlocking the **actual core of the challenge** that was previously unreachable due to the early failure path.

---

Next step:  
Now that we've accessed these new decrypted code blocks, the focus should shift to analyzing them one by one

### Final Discovery: Rebuilding the Flag

A quick glance at the newly decrypted code reveals a key clue ‚Äî the string:

```bash
HTB{}
```

### Final Steps

By continuing the same process ‚Äî allowing the program to:

1. **Decrypt each section at runtime**
    
2. **Step through the decrypted logic**
    
3. **Extract or observe ASCII values being processed or compared**
    

‚Äîwe're able to **manually reconstruct the full HTB flag!**

## ‚úÖ Challenges Encountered / Lessons Learned

This challenge was deceptively simple at first glance but required a deeper understanding of **runtime behavior**, especially in how binaries can **self-decrypt portions of their code**. Key lessons learned:

- **Static analysis is not always enough** ‚Äî the real logic was hidden and only accessible during execution.
    
- Understanding Windows APIs like `VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualProtect`, and `VirtualFree` is essential when dealing with self-modifying or decrypted code.
    
- **Patching** is a valid and powerful tool for bypassing undesired behavior in challenges like this (e.g., NOP-ing early `exit` calls).
---
##  üèÅ Conclusion

The _Partial Encryption_ challenge from Hack The Box showcased a clever use of **partial runtime code decryption** to hide the real flag validation logic. By using:

- Careful dynamic analysis in IDA,
    
- Smart patching to bypass early exits,
    
- And step-by-step decryption tracking,
    

‚Ä¶we uncovered the actual core logic and rebuilt the HTB flag by observing how individual characters were checked in memory.

This challenge was a perfect example of how reversing can go beyond just analyzing static instructions ‚Äî it demands creativity, persistence, and a solid grasp of both assembly and system internals.

## üí° Additional Notes / Reflections

- It's worth noting that challenges like this can help build your intuition for **real-world malware behavior**, which often leverages encrypted payloads and selective memory execution.
    
- The decrypted routines clearly used **per-character comparisons**, meaning brute-forcing the flag was technically possible but inefficient ‚Äî analyzing the code flow was faster and more educational.
